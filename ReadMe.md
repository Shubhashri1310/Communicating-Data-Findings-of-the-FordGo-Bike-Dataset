<font size="8"> FordGo Bike System Dateset 2018

# Dataset

- <font size="4">  Overall 1863721 entries were gathered from the FordGo Bike dataset belonging to the year 2018 to carry out the analysis. The Fordgo Bike data source mentioned on the Udacity page did not include member_birth_year and member_gender column. So, I downloaded the data from a different source i.e., https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/201801-fordgobike-tripdata.csv.zip , https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/201802-fordgobike-tripdata.csv.zip and so on for the rest of the months of 2018.The dataset contains the data about Bike rental service which is a public bike sharing system in San Francisco. It contains the trip data about all the bike riders as the bike_id, start_station,end_station and many other fields. Furthermore, it also preserves the data about the bike riders as-in the type of user i'e., customer or subscriber, gender and birth_year.


# Summary of Findings 


- <font size="4"> The Fordgo Bike service is being availed by lot of riders in San Francisco. The riders are categorized into two groups namely Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are the group of people who own a membership in the FordGo Bike service and Customers are the tourists or people who occasionally avail the bike service to take a city tour. Subscribers being the daily commutes hire bikes on weekdays around 8-9 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon. Subscribers are the office going folks who travel on weekdays and prefer to take rest on weekends thereby, falling the bike hirings on weekends by Subscribers. The frequency of customers renting bikes is comparatively quite lesser to the subscribers on weekdays as they are in no hurry to go for work. Customers preferably choose to go out post 5 p.m on the weekdays when the sun is about to set, so that they catch a glimpse of the beautiful sunset and feel relaxed indulging into the pleasant atmosphere.While, on weekends, the customers prefer leaving at early noon for exploring the city. There is a month-wise pattern to bike hirings done. The customers increase in number from January till July and then slowly, the graph goes down till the last month. Whereas, the subscriber count goes high in the month of October. The highest bike hirings by Subscribers are done in the month of October. Considering the ratio of Males : Females into this system, the ratio is roughly 7 : 3 respectively. Although the female count is quite low on an average, they take longer trips than the males both on weekdays and weekends. The age factor affects the bike hirings. As, the age goes on increasing, the frequency of bike hiring goes down. The age-group under 18-32 are the most common bike riders in the city as so many people under that category hire bikes. The people having age greater than that seem to account for less bike hirings.


# Key Insights For Presentation

- <font size="4">   For the presentation, I concentrate on the pattern that is observed after plotting various different plots against different variables. The major portion of focus is the subscribers making high use of the fordgo bike rentals compared to the customers. Also, a lot to observe about the pattern of bike hiring according to the days of the week, months and according to the age factor.
